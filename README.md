Sorting_algorithms:


-> Quick Sort - In insertion sort we pick up an element from the array known as Pivot, then we compare each element to this pivot and place all the elements smaller than the pivot to the left side of the pivot while the larger elements to the right. Similarly we know pick up the elements that are placed left of the pivot and again sort them. * For better understanding -> https://youtu.be/COk73cpQbFQ


-> Merge Sort - In merge sort we break the array into 2 separate arrays and we continue breaking it until we get individual elements now these individual elements are compared and placed in the right position. * For better understanding -> https://youtu.be/TzeBrDU-JaY
