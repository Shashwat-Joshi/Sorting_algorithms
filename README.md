# Sorting Algorithms:

### Insertion Sort
This is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm. In this algorithm, a sub-array is maintained which is always sorted. Whenever any element has to be inserted into this sorted sub-array, it has to find it's appropriate place in the sorted sub-array and then inserted there. The array is searched sequentially and unsorted items are moved and inserted into the sorted sub-array (in the same array). This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2), where n is the number of items.

### Quick Sort
In quick sort we pick up an element from the array known as Pivot, then we compare each element to this pivot and place all the elements smaller than the pivot to the left side of the pivot while the larger elements to the right. Similarly we know pick up the elements that are placed left of the pivot and again sort them.

### Merge Sort
In merge sort we break the array into 2 separate arrays and we continue breaking it until we get individual elements now these individual elements are compared and placed in the right position.
